\section{My own performance }
I did not do well, underestimated the project
which was quite involved; looking at other back-ends 
I thought piece of cake but guess what, they were
toys. 

The OCaml expressivity comes at a cost which is complexity,
I believe I underestimated that, however it helped that
I was familiar to Haskell to an extent. 


\subsection{Modules}
unikernel run
make them user friend

Functors in a way try to fulfill some of the things that
dependent types do


the Idris type system should be powerful enough to express them
