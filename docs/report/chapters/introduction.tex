brief description of idris and Idris-malfunction, what they are
and what they tried to achieve (performance) 

scope was to enhance the OCaml interoperability so that libraries 
and other cool stuff can be used in Idris 

also, to solve some of the ergonomic problems with the back-end 
like slower code generation etc which increased drastically after 
switching to generating code using Text

\section{Towards a more practical Idris}



\section{Objectives}
build an FFI 

build a lib IO 

build etc.

\section{Contributions}
OCaml FFI 

Added flag to Malfunction

Improve the prev back-end  (ergonomic problems)
	- added AST allows to now generate ast instead, potentially reusable
	- solve some laziness bugs with the help of Malfunction 
	- faster code generation using Data.Text
	- implement more primitives 
	- modularize the code base 
	- added support for flags from the outside --cg-opt
	- can export functions as cmx 
	- a few more test cases

on the side of idris, an io for interfacing with OCaml library

an OCaml wrapper for interfacing with the Obj OCaml library for
interacting with OCaml runtime values. 

a few examples of Idris interfacing with OCaml like the
grahphics

a Docker image suitable for developing haskell and OCaml
based projects, Opam + stack etc.

a basic simple encoding of OCaml complex module system in
a dependent typed way using Idris upon which to build
upon and support properly
