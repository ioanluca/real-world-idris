\section{Idris and dependent types}
\subsection{Idris}
Idris\footnote{\url{https://www.idris-lang.org/}} is and is not

Not popular slow etc 


\subsection{Other code generators for Idris}
idris malfunction  wrong defs

idris ocaml wrong  wrong defs 

\section{OCaml}
high performance, garbage collected etc

functional and optimized with flambda

\section{Malfunction}
thin wrapper around lambda and untyped

motivation for it, Stephen's etc

pretty feature rich tbh, especially after adding support
for floating point numbers and laziness

\section{Other code generation back-ends for Idris}

\section{Idris-Malfunction}
built upon Stephens experimental 
not good because was using the wrong decls
constructors were inefficient

goes pretty fast, probably because \ldots
benchmarks
