\section{Motivation}
no libraries no popularity no etc

Is Idris production ready?
Idris is primarily a research tool for exploring the possibilities of software development with dependent types, meaning that the primary goal is not (yet) to make a system which could be used in production. As such, there are a few rough corners, and lots of missing libraries. Nobody is working on Idris full time, and we don’t have the resources at the moment to polish the system on our own. Therefore, we don’t recommend building your business around it!

Having said that, contributions which help towards making Idris suitable for use in production would be very welcome - this includes (but is not limited to) extra library support, polishing the run-time system (and ensuring it is robust), providing and maintaining a JVM back end, etc.


For example, it is possible to compile Idris to JavaScript or to C
to run in the browser or natively. 

Idris supports multiple code generation backends.

\section{Approach}

maybe include some of the deliverables here

\section{Functionality}

call OCaml code

interface with it? to what extent

break down what calling OCaml is supposed to be like
foreign calls whats supported whats not
