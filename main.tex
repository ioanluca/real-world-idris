\chapter{Introduction}
	Submission of this, along with feedback from your supervisor, must be done
	via Myplace.
	This deliverable is timed to ensure that you get together with your
	supervisor without undue delay and scope out the project.
	The submission should contain the following.
	You should write a short report (no more than 4 pages) that includes:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An overview of what the project is to achieve. This should be reasonably substantial
		      â€“ either two or three paragraphs in length.
		\item A preliminary list of achievable objectives for the project.
		\item A preliminary survey of related work.
		\item A brief overview of the methodology to be followed
		      (i.e., how the specification, design, implementation and verification
		      of the project will be approached).
		\item A brief overview of how the end product will be evaluated.
		\item An initial project plan scheduling the development of the project from now until the
		      project submission deadline.
		\item A choice of marking scheme (see the section Marking Schemes ) to be used to assess the
		      project, together with the reasons for choosing that particular scheme
	\end{itemize}

	At the end of the report you should include comments made by your supervisor about your
	report (no more than two paragraphs) - these paragraphs should comment on the extent
	to which you appear to understand the nature and scope of the project, and to
	appreciate where the challenges in it lie.
	It is expected that the objectives of the project will be refined as the project
	progresses and that the related work will be expanded and appropriately described
	for the final report. It is also expected that the project plan will change as the
	project progresses.
