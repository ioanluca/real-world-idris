	\frametitle{A little bit about Idris}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item pure functional language inspired by Haskell
		\item has dependent types, so can encode complex properties
		      about programs into types enabling ``Type-Driven Development''
		\item i.e. allows formal lightweight verification --- proving
		      correctness of programs inside the source code itself,
		      much like mathematical theorem proving
		\item programming becomes a very interactive experience
		      --- devs think about interesting functionality of their programs
		      and the compiler figures out where it is/could be useful
		\item so it's quite new and innovative --- mostly innovative innovative
		      in the academic world at the moment
		\item Idris-Malfunction, recent work to solve the performance gap
	\end{itemize}

	\frametitle{Overview}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item essentially an enhancement of the Idris ecosystem
		that aims to make it more suitable for practical
		programming (for the ``Real World'')
		\item a (two-way) Foreign Function Interface (FFI) that
		      allows calling OCaml
		      from Idris and vice-versa --- to be built on top of the
		      compiler backend I wrote
		\item Why? --- OCaml is a very popular ``battle-tested'' 
			  functional language
	    \item Lots of modular, secure and fast software has been written in item
	    \item MirageOS is on such example and it works as a library, so we'd 
			  like to use Mirage in Idris for instance
		\item to build an HTTP server...
	\end{itemize}

	\frametitle{Mirage}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item written in OCaml
		\item library OS --- amazing for building safe and
		blazing fast network apps
		\item basically provides the only the minimal set of low-level
		functionality that your app needs and strips down all the
		heavy bits of a fully-fledged OS
		\item constructs unikernels that can be deployed on
		a variety of platforms --- hardware (\$5 ESP32 chip)
		or hypervisor (AWS)
		\item secure and incredibly fast
	\end{itemize}
